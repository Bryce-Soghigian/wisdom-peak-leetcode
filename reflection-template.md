## Notes About Problem Constraints and the problem statement

## Approaches


### Approach 1 | TC O(N) + NlogN | Space O(N)
- Approach Notes
1. Step 1 | TC = O(N), SC = O(N) 
2. Step 2 | TC = (NlogN), SC = O(1)

### Approach 2 | TC | SC
1. Step 1
2. Step 2


### Testcases
```python
class TestSolution:
    """
    Test solution Using Zombie
	1. Zero Case
	2. One Case
	3. Many Case
	4. Boundary Conditions
	5. Interface Definiton
	6. Exceptions 

    """
    def test_main():
	assert "case 1" = result of solution
